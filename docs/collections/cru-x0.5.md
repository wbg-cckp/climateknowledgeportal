# CRU TS

CRU TS (Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series) is the most widely used observational climate dataset. Data is presented on a 0.5° latitude by 0.5° longitude grid over all land domains except Antarctica. It is derived by the interpolation of monthly climate anomalies from extensive networks of weather station observations. The CRU TS version 4.07 gridded dataset is derived from observational data and provides quality-controlled temperature and rainfall values from thousands of weather stations worldwide, as well as derivative products including monthly climatologies and long term historical climatologies. The dataset is produced by the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia (UEA)
